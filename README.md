# Palette-Generator-V1

In early 2020, i created this palette generator to test my javascript skills. I was very new to javascript and i barely had any idea of what i was doing, i mostly just copied and paste code that i found on tutorials.
A year later, after spending two weeks into learning javascript in my coding bootcamp, i decided to revist my early JS projects and revamp them into somehting better. 
You can view my palette generator version 2 on my github repository.
